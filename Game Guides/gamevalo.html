    <p class = "description">Valorant is a team-based tactical shooter and first-person shooter. Players play as one of a set of agents, characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Teams will alternate sides after 12 rounds and the first team to win 13 rounds will win the match. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability which requires charging through kills, deaths, or spike actions. This guide seeks to provides tips and tricks that will help you improve your gameplay in order to frag-out with your friends!</p>

    
  <h3 class = "running">1. Don't Run and Gun</h3>
      
      <p class = "description1">First and foremost, it is important to note that you should not be running and shooting, especially from longer distances, because that will decrease your gun accuracy immensely. Running, in general, is also discouraged as it creates a lot of noise on the map revealing the location to the enemy. You can tell where players will be able to hear you running by identifying the radius around your character on the minimap. In Valorant, information is the key to winning. You should only be running is when your noise radius is far from the enemy, when your location has already been revealed, or when your team is rushing site.</p>

  <h3 class = "strafe">2. Strafe Shooting</h3>
  
  <p class = "description2">This tip is an extension to the last. If you’re not supposed to run and gun, how should you be using your weaponry? Your gun shots in Valorant will only be accurate if you’re absolutely still; however, it takes a delayed moment to go from a moving state to being still. Alternatively, when you move from side to side, using the “a” and “d” keys, your character will have a moment of absolute stillness as you change directions because the side movements will cancel out one another. This is extremely helpful when you’re peaking an angle that an enemy is currently holding, allowing you to peak and take a shot before going back into cover.</p>

<h3 class = "crosshair">3. Crosshair Placement</h3>
    
  <p class = "description3">Like most FPS games, headshots with most weapons in Valorant will net you a kill on an enemy with full health and shield. Headshots in general will deal more damage to enemies than body or leg shots; hence, you should always be aiming for the head. In order to get those easy one taps, your aim, or crosshair, should always be at head level and aiming at angles where enemies could be or possibly peak out. In the instance that an enemy appears out of an angle you’re holding, with good crosshair placement, you will need to adjust less in order to get those crispy dinks to the head. </p>

    <h3 class = "preaim">4. Preaiming Common Angles</h3>
    
    <p class = "description4">Pre-aiming is when you know where an enemy is, and you pre-aim your crosshair onto his head before you go around cover. The key is to lock your crosshair onto a specific position and therefore ignore every other possible angle. This requires repetition in playing the game and learning the maps to identify which angles are “common” holding angles for the enemy. The difference between preaiming to crosshair placement is that the latter is a more general use of your crosshair. It’s about how you place your crosshair on every angle, making sure that it’s always in the height of the enemies head, even if it’s on a higher or a lower level.</p>

    <h3 class = "practice">5. Practice, Practice, Practice</h3>
    
    <p class = "description5">Mastering these tips will surely net you more kills in your games but the best way to improve your game is by practicing. Getting in repetitions will allow you to gain comfortability with your mouse, sensitivity, keyboard, movement, etc… Valorant provides players with a Practice Range, where players can practice all types of mechanics of the game with bots. Additionally, you can download aim-training simulators with set game modes to let you practice individual mechanics such as Aim Lab (free on steam).</p>
